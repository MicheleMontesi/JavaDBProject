# JavaDBProject

This project is a Java application for managing a database that automates the operations of a community offering services to psychiatric patients, including patients and employees.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of JavaDBProject is to provide an efficient system for managing the following entities:
- **Patients**: Records personal information such as tax code, first name, last name, date of birth, and gender. It tracks the medical history, diagnosis, and rehabilitation plan of each patient, assigning specific therapies and maintaining a history of therapies. It also records medications administered to patients.
- **Employees**: Manages personal data of employees, including contract details and acquired certifications. It tracks employee shifts, defining when and where they work.
- **Operational Units**: Records information about various operational units, such as apartment groups or psychiatric health residences, including bed capacity, location, and authorization details.
- **Medications**: Manages an inventory of medications, including code, name, pharmaceutical company, purchase dates, and expiration dates.
